# Bolo Boys Website

Mobile-first single-page website for [Bolo Boys](https://www.instagram.com/boloboysband/) — an Atlanta- and Macon-based three-piece live band. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What this repo is

A static site (`index.html`) plus structured JSON data files. No build step. No framework. Push to `main`, GitHub Pages deploys.

```

## How to add or update a show

1. Edit `data/events.json` — add a new entry or modify an existing one. Schema example is at the top of the file under `_schema_example`.
2. If the venue isn't already in `data/venues.json`, add it there too.
3. Preview locally (see below).
4. Commit and push to `main`. GitHub Pages will redeploy in ~1 minute.

The site fetches `data/events.json` at runtime, so edits to event data take effect as soon as the deploy lands — no other files need to change.

## How to preview locally

The site fetches JSON files at runtime, which means **opening `index.html` directly with `file://` will not work** — the browser blocks `fetch` from local files for security reasons.

Run a tiny local server from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

## How the site deploys

GitHub Pages serves from the `main` branch. Every push to `main` triggers a redeploy (typically under a minute). There is no build step.

To check deploy status: GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages**.

## Asset conventions

- **`assets/`** — site-wide images that ship with every page load (hero, band photo, carousel).
- **`assets/posters/`** — show flyers and posters. One file per event, named after the event's `id` (e.g. `gateway-park-grant-park-2026-05-17.jpeg`). Referenced from `events.json` via the optional `poster_url` field. Build the archive over time so we always have a repository to draw from.
- **`assets/pictures/`** — other show-specific photography (not posters).
- **In-progress design files** (rough drafts, working PSDs, design experiments) should live outside the repo or in a folder added to `.gitignore`. Don't commit them — keep the repo lean.

## What's *not* in this repo

Private working files live in a sibling folder (`../Bolo Boys - Private/`), gitignored and never deployed:

- `Bolo Boys CRM.xlsx` — booking and contact spreadsheet.
- `data/distribution-list.json` — show announcement distribution list.
- `docs/promotion-research.md` — internal booking and promotion strategy.
- `CLAUDE.md` — AI assistant context (brand rules, tone, workflow).

Personal calendar / email integration is handled outside the site via the band's shared Gmail (`boloboysband@gmail.com`) and shared Google Calendar.

## Working with AI assistants

Structured band facts live in `data/band.json` — committed to the repo so anyone (human or AI) can pick up the project. Additional context (persona, tone, workflow rules) lives in `CLAUDE.md` in the sibling private folder; AI tools working in this repo should be pointed at both.
